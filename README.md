- **Animations**: React Native Reanimated 3
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage for persistent data
- **State Management**: Custom hooks with React state

### Key Components

#### Game Engine
- `useGameState` - Core game logic and state management
- `gameLogic.ts` - Physics calculations and game mechanics
- Block collision detection with precision scoring
- Camera system with smooth following

#### UI Components
- `ModeSelector` - Game mode selection interface
- `TimeAttackUI` - Time-based game interface
- `ChallengeUI` - Challenge mode progress tracking
- `ThemeSelector` - Theme customization interface

- Optimized re-renders with React.memo and useCallback
- Smooth 60fps gameplay on various devices
- Memory-efficient asset management

## üéØ Game Mechanics

### Block Types
- **Normal**: Standard blocks with regular physics
- **Slippery**: Reduced friction, faster movement, harder to align perfectly
- **Heavy**: Slower movement, easier perfect alignment, visual weight indicators
- **Irregular**: Unique movement patterns for added challenge

### Scoring System
- Base score increases with tower height
- Perfect alignment doubles the score
- Combo multipliers for consecutive perfect blocks
- Mode-specific score multipliers
- Bonus coins based on performance

### Challenge Objectives
1. **Perfect Start**: Stack 5 blocks with perfect alignment
2. **Speed Demon**: Stack 10 blocks in 30 seconds
3. **Slippery Slope**: Handle slippery blocks successfully
4. **Heavy Duty**: Master heavy block mechanics
5. **Master Builder**: Ultimate mixed-block challenge
